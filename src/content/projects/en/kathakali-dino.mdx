# Kathakali Mudra Recognition with DINOv3

A computer vision project for recognizing and classifying **Kathakali** classical dance mudras (hand gestures) using Meta's **DINOv3** vision transformer model.

## üìñ Overview

Kathakali is a highly stylized classical Indian dance-drama from Kerala, known for its elaborate costumes, detailed gestures, and expressive movements. Central to this art form are the intricate hand gestures called **Mudras**, which form a sophisticated vocabulary for storytelling. This project leverages state-of-the-art computer vision to automatically recognize and classify these mudras, serving as a tool for learning, preservation, and digital analysis of this ancient art form.

The project utilizes **DINOv3**, Meta AI's self-supervised vision transformer, fine-tuned specifically for Kathakali mudra recognition.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Accurate Mudra Classification:** Identifies single-hand (Asamyukta) and combined-hand (Samyukta) Kathakali mudras from images with high precision
*   **State-of-the-Art Backbone:** Powered by DINOv3's powerful self-supervised visual features
*   **Multiple Inference Modes:** 
  - Single image classification
  - Batch processing for multiple images
  - Real-time webcam demonstration
*   **Transfer Learning:** Leverages pre-trained DINOv3 weights for efficient training with limited data
*   **Modular Architecture:** Clean, well-organized code for easy experimentation and extension

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sree14hari/Kathakali-Mudra_DinoV3.git
    cd Kathakali-Mudra_DinoV3
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Data Preparation
Organize your dataset in the following structure:
```
data/
  train/
    pataka/
      image_001.jpg
      image_002.jpg
      ...
    tripataka/
    mayura/
    ...
  val/
    pataka/
    tripataka/
    ...
  test/
    pataka/
    tripataka/
    ...
```
## üß† Model Architecture

This project uses **DINOv3** (Vision Transformer) as the feature extractor with a custom classification head:

- **Backbone:** DINOv3 ViT-B/14 or ViT-L/14
- **Feature Extraction:** Self-supervised pre-trained weights
- **Classifier:** Custom MLP head adapted for mudra classification
- **Input Resolution:** 224√ó224 or 518√ó518 pixels
